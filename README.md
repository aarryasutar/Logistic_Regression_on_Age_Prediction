# Logistic Regression on Age Prediction

## 1.Dataset Preparation
Before training the model, prepare your dataset. This involves selecting the features and the target variable:
- **Features**: These are the input variables used to predict the target. For example, columns like `PAQ605`, `BMXBMI`, `LBXGLU`, `LBXGLT`, and `LBXIN` might be used as features.
- **Target Variable**: This is the output variable you want to predict. In binary classification, it could be something like `age_group`, where the goal is to classify each instance into one of two classes (e.g., 0 or 1).

## 2.Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into two parts: training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. This helps to ensure that the model is tested on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.

## 3.Model Training
Train your machine learning model using the training set. In this case, a logistic regression model is used. Logistic regression is a statistical method for binary classification that predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

## 4.Model Prediction
Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions on the testing set. The model will output probabilities for each class. Convert these probabilities into binary class labels (e.g., 0 or 1) based on a threshold, typically 0.5.

#### 5.Calculate Performance Metrics
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances. It is expressed as a decimal and can be converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100.
- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. It reflects how many of the predicted positives are actually positive.
- **Recall**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. It shows how well the model identifies positive instances.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate the model's performance.
- **ROC-AUC**: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. It evaluates the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes. A higher AUC value indicates better model performance.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. Although typically used for regression, it can provide insight into prediction errors in classification problems.

## 6.Store and Display Results
Store the performance metrics for each feature or model variant in a structured format. Print the results to review and compare the performance across different features or models.

## 7.Identify the Best Feature
Determine which feature or model variant provides the best performance. This is usually done by comparing accuracy or another primary metric across different features. The feature with the highest accuracy is considered the best.
